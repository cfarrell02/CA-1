# Vaccination Centre Management System

This project is a simple vaccination centre management system that allows users to add appointments in booths in centres. The system also stores patient information. This system is implemented in Java using JavaFX for the GUI, and a custom data structure called CoolLinkedList to store the data.

CoolLinkedList is a custom data structure that is implemented using a linked list. It is a generic data structure that can store any type of data.
